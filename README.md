# Solving for India Challenge

The Solving for India Challenge is a 3-month long challenge to solve for India's most pressing problems. The challenge is open to all, and is a great opportunity to learn, build, and contribute to India's growth.

## Description

This project takes medical parameters such as Height, Weight and Sodium and helps doctors, dieticians, and patients calculate daily nutritional requirements, provides personalized nutrition recommendations.

## Approach to the problem

We have trained the model using a collection of data that has the following features:

- Haemoglobin
- Urea
- Creatine
- Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS)
- HbA1c
- SGOT: Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
- SGPT: Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase
- Sodium
- Potassium

These features will be used by our state-of-the art custom model NeutriNet to predict the daily nutritional requirements of the patient. This data has been sourced from health facilities in Chennai and has been verified by several health experts in
Chennai. Through this project, we aim to provide a platform for doctors, dieticians, and patients to calculate daily nutritional requirements, and provide personalized nutrition recommendations.

In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy and balanced diet can be a challenge. With so many conflicting opinions and overwhelming amounts of nutritional information available, it can be difficult to know what to eat to achieve optimal health. In response to this challenge, our team has developed an advanced custom model called NeutriNet, which leverages state-of-the-art features to predict the daily nutritional requirements of each patient with precision and ease.

NeutriNet is a cutting-edge tool that harnesses advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to deliver personalized nutrition recommendations to each patient. The model is designed to incorporate a broad range of factors, including an individual's age, gender, weight, height, physical activity levels, and overall health status. By analyzing this data, NeutriNet can determine an individual's daily nutritional needs, including the ideal amounts of protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals required to maintain optimal health.

To ensure that NeutriNet delivers accurate and reliable nutritional data, we have sourced information from leading health facilities in Chennai. This data has been thoroughly vetted by a team of experienced health experts to ensure that it meets the highest standards of accuracy and reliability. By leveraging this data, we can provide our users with a comprehensive platform for calculating their daily nutritional requirements and receiving personalized recommendations that are tailored to their unique health goals.

Through our innovative project, our aim is to provide doctors, dieticians, and patients alike with an accessible and easy-to-use tool for calculating daily nutritional requirements. By streamlining this process and making it more user-friendly, we hope to empower individuals to take control of their health and achieve their desired health outcomes. Our platform is designed to be user-friendly, with a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and understand.
